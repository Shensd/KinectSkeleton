# KinectSkeleton

This is a simple app that grabs data from the Xbox Kinect and draws it as a wireframe body model

## How it works
* Kinect must be connected before startup of app
* Uses the Microsoft Kinect SDK
* Grabs skeleton data and draws it into the window
* If video option is enabled, it attempts to scale the skeleton to the associated body

## About
 * Kinect SDK can be found [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect)
 * There are many other programs that do the same as this one, this was just a way for me to get a feel of how to develop with the Kinect SDK
